## Prerequisites
You need to have MySQL installed and you will need any database tool to work with MySQL.
To setup the database and user for the application, run [this script](https://github.com/jasmin-30/spring-rest-mvc-demo/blob/master/src/scripts/mysql-init.sql) using any database tool.

## Running an application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Voila! Your application is running on port `8080`.
